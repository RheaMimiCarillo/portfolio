      "description": "Hi, my name is Rhea Mimi Carillo and I use she/her pronouns. I'm a software dev developing my skills at Code Fellows. My background is in military civil engineering: think, cartography, land survey, and computer aided drafting. What I really like to do is solve puzzles. My friends, family, and co-workers know me as for as the troubleshooting whiz and what is troubleshooting but another puzzle? I enjoy coding, because it gives me a box to think outside of and allows me immediate feedback as I'm tinkering with problems, which allows me quickly change gears when I'm on to something up until I finally reach that 'Eureka!' moment. A career in the tech field seems right up my alley to further stretch and grow my analytical muscles for practical applications.",
